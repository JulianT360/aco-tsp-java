# Ant Colony Optimization to solve Travelling Salesman Problem in Java

## Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) try the solve the following problem: "For a given list of cities (vertices) and the distances beteween each pair of cities (edges), what is the shortest route that visits each city only one time and return to the origin city?". It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations reasearch and theorical computer science. 
In the theory of computational complexity the deterministic algorithms that execute all posibilities to try to find the best route needs a long (very long) time to find the solution. The main point is that, the complexity of the problem increase exponentially with the number of cities, so a metaheuristic that do not guarantee the best solution but can found an suboptimal solution is a good alternative to solve the TSP in a acceptable time.
A the following image is an example of the TSP problem resolved:
